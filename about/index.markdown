I've been hesitating to put some words together because I can't really see the common thread between the things that interest me: [me]({{ "/tag/me" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), [music]({{ "/tag/music" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), [faith]({{ "/tag/faith" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), productivity, art, ethics, [society]({{ "/tag/society" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), church, [technology]({{ "/tag/tech" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), writing. The faith stuff is weird among the tech crowd. The tech stuff (maybe *my* tech stuff) is dry or irrelevant to others. The productivity stuff is annoying to everyone.

Why would I put these disparate words together? Maybe if I could find a common theme that underlies them... What do they have in common? Nothing much.

I've written in bursts through the years. I also write a lot of sermons, but I won't put those all here. Try [here](http://sermons.netfull.org) for those. I have...concerns with the big social media corporations but you could probably find me if you look hard enough.
