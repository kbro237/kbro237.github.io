I have a feeling that many Americans will be going to the polls without a lot of passion for their candidate. You know, the whole 'lesser of two evils' idea. I have to confess that I am not exactly passionate about the candidate I'll be voting for.

But let me offer another motivation for voting: survival. No, not mine -- as a white man, the American system already has a lot of momentum towards protecting my interests. I'll be using my vote to help preserve others.

We have a candidate who has consistently -- in his life, in his campaign, and in his suggested policies -- discriminated against, diminished, and endangered the lives of people of color, women, Muslims, immigrants, refugees, people with disabilities, and those he simply considers 'losers.' He has been endorsed by numerous white supremacist, nativist, and anti-Semitic groups that have never before endorsed a major candidate. Behind him are people who believe we would be 'great again' by controlling and diminishing the lives of certain classes of humans.

For the sake of those fellow humans, cast your vote accordingly. No, we aren't there yet, but despite his bleak, autocratic vision of the country, we could actually live up to the unfulfilled promise we started with that we are stronger when we not only tolerate but embrace the tired, poor, huddled masses yearning to breathe free. That we will be a better nation because of the free contributions of those who have been previously enslaved and destroyed because of fear. That real 'greatness' will come not from looking back toward a time of greater domination, but forward to a time of greater love.

Even if you aren't completely smitten with your candidate, be passionate about *that* when you go to the polls. And vote accordingly.
