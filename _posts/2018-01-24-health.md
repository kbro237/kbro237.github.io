I spent way too much of 2017 sick. 

My goal for 2018 is to be much healthier. Some causes of illness are out of my control (like having small children in the house) but many are in my control. Here are some things I should do to be healthier:

- sleep at least 7.5 hours a night
- make a smoothie for breakfast daily
- wash hands every scene change
- keep hands off face
- go to the gym weekly 
- do yoga a couple times a week
- do meditation daily
