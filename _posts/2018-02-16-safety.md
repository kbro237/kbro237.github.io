Sen. Marco Rubio, in [2014](http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-marco-rubio-nra-20140425-story.html), in a bid to raise his NRA rating from a `B+` to an `A`:

> The safety of our families is not something people should hope government can provide.



Martin Luther and the Reformers, in 1530, in the [Augsburg Confession:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg_Confession)

> [Government defends] not minds, but bodies and bodily things against manifest injuries, and restrain[s] men with the sword and bodily punishments in order to preserve civil justice and peace.

I'd wager more Americans would agree with the 500 year old statement than with Sen. Rubio's.
