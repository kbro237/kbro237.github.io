Clay Shirkey banned laptops in class even though he is a proponent of technology. But distraction is like secondhand smoke: it hurts us *and* the group. Our basic urges follow distraction down rabbit holes before we even have time to stop it. He now seems himself working together with students against these tendencies by banning devices. 

Attention is precious in our faith. The church should also work together, when appropriate, to limit distraction without demonizing technology.
