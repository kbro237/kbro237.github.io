When you make music, you call up a lot of ghosts. American music no less than any other.

This country may be new, but its people are ancient.
When you play its music, you're responsible -- if not *to* them, then *for* them.

If your melody waxes nostalgic for Dixie, then your words better talk the ghosts down.
