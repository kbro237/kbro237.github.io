We can use the growing resources of electronic communication to bring
the gospel message to many who have not heard. But we need to
investigate the *message* and the *medium*. Because this isn't about
producing electronic tracts. That would be called *spam*. This is about
*real* connections that draw us to *real* relationships that, put
together, represent God's work in this particular place, in this
particular time.

We can't pretend the Internet doesn't exist. It does; at least for those
people living in developing nations. We also can't assume that
Christians have a monopoly on this new medium, as we did with past
technological advances. We don't. And thank God that Christendom is
over. But between naivet√© and arrogance, Christians are called to engage
these new electronic tools and work that they may be used justly and
effectively.

We may even have something to say about how our new tools should be used
for the better. But first we need to learn what it all this means for
doing ministry---the same ministry that the church has always done.
