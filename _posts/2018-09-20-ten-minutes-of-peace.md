If you use an iOS device and you've upgraded to iOS 12, do yourself a favor and add this Shortcut, ["Ten Minutes of Peace"](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/9944fb2be0f648778a717e95bcbe9fdc). You'll need to download Apple's Shortcuts app if you haven't already.

All it does is turn on your Do Not Disturb setting for ten minutes and then turn it back off again. But during that time -- no buzzing, dinging, vibrating: bliss.

[Add it to Siri](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-12-the-macstories-review/8/#add-to-siri) and get yourself ten minutes of peace just by asking.
