[Is Facebook evil? Everything bad about Facebook is bad for the same reason — Quartz](https://qz.com/1342757/everything-bad-about-facebook-is-bad-for-the-same-reason/)

Without question, Facebook enables brutal and immoral hatemongers. I can hear Facebook arguing that they cannot possibly take a stand on moral issues without becoming censors and losing objectivity. Facebook cannot make those decisions without messing up a lot of the time. I agree. Its scale is just too massive.

That's just the thing: Facebook can't admit it, but it's possible that the most moral thing is for Facebook *not* to exist.
