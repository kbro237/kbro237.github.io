On the movies of Clint Eastwood, by *The New Yorker:*

> “Mass culture is a machine for showing desire,” Roland Barthes
> wrote. It’s also a machine for expressing resentment, a frustration
> of desire. Harry Callahan is lonely, hard, intolerant. Eastwood became 
> popular, in part, because he allowed people to dream that they could
> be effective without being nice.

What does our mass culture desire today? Winning arguments and passing
judgment according to cable news and reality television...
