When I fall apart under stress it  looks like this:

- I become disillusioned with everything: with myself, with others, faith, etc. My cynicism which is often held at bay takes over. It's hard to remain motivated. 
- I get tired. 
- I do not look for help; in fact, I probably avoid it. I tell myself it's not good for me to show signs of weakness due to stress. Because then, I say, others will have to be inconvenienced. 
- I do not think clearly or do my best work. 
- I do not have courageous compassion for others.
