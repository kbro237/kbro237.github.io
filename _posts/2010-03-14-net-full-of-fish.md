Internet full of fish
---------------------

It was inevitable that the single most profound technological revolution
of the 20th century would eventually be mentioned in conversation with
the Christian Gospel. It's a meeting of a Christian's most urgent
communication---the good news of Jesus Christ---with this century's most
advanced medium---the Internet.

Like the Gutenberg revolution, though, the advancement of the Internet
is not simply by degree over traditional media, but rather by radical
change to the way Western society works, plays, and even thinks.

Strictly speaking, as a medium, the Internet cannot ensure value. Those
things that are most important to us are still contained in the
message---wherever that message may be found. In the quoted verse, the
disciples have a net. Sure, it's not an *inter*net, but I trust you'll
forgive the wordplay. The net alone, though, was not enough to catch
fish. The disciples followed Jesus to fill their net with fish.

Where are the fish? 
-------------------

As our recent generations of disciples have begun using the Internet,
they've also discovered disappointment. Despite its increasing ubiquity
in our society, the net does not provide all the fish it promises. Many
churches have invested in the Internet with hopes that it will provide
new relationships and a generation of members that has been missing from
their pews. Instead of nets full of fish, many churches find their
Internet presence dwindling and lifeless. Our web sites may even be
diligently maintained, but what fish are we finding?

What are we called to *do* with our Internet?

Jesus called the disciples in the boat 'children.' After reading any
number of anonymous 'comments' on a public site like YouTube, you'll
probably agree the label still fits. Like any new technology, the
Internet has multiplied the ways in which we communicate, but it has by
no means taught us how to communicate *better*. As it becomes harder and
harder for us to avoid the Internet, we are more and more called to work
on communicating authentically in this new medium. We have a lot to
learn. Before we cast our new nets to the sea, let's think about using
them responsibly. Let's listen for direction.

"You will find some."
---------------------

If we put our faith in our new net alone, we will be disappointed.
Without centering our work in the Gospel, the energy we put into making
our place on the Internet will be wasted. The promise of an online
church, free of walls and limitations is empty and dangerous. The last
thing we need is a *virtual* church. But for those who humbly take up
their nets, listening for the voice of Jesus, the promise is there, "you
will find some." We will know we've learned to use our new technology
appropriately when our nets are full of fish.

And then our real work begins.
