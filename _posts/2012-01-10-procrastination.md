The Obvious One
---------------

I just don't want to do it.

**Solution:**
Just do it.

The Pernicious One
------------------

I'm feeling guilty about not completing the task yet, but I would rather avoid it then deal with that feeling and the consequences. This one usually makes itself worse.

**Solution:**
Forgive myself for the delay. Then, just do it.

The Narcissistic One
--------------------

I need the last minute pressure of the approaching deadline to force me give up on my silly perfectionism and accept less-than-perfect work from myself.

**Solution:**
Manage expectations about what kind of time and energy I can put into a project/task, then just do it.

The Cynical One
---------------

I'm nursing the task in my own task list because it keeps me in control of the project, instead of putting the ball in someone else's court where it belongs.

**Solution:**
Sharing is caring, and I'm in the caring business. Let someone else do it.
